# KickStartTrustee

KickStartTrustee is a framework to get you started building your own data trustee.

Repository organization:

- The docs folders contains the complete documentation for the framework. Its content is published at https://fraunhofer-iese.github.io/KickStartTrustee/
- The src folders contains an example data trustee implementation

## Docs

We are using markdown pages to document the framework. Those pages will be rendered to html files using the default github pages action and deployed on the github page of the repository.

### Breadcrumbs

The cayman does not support additional navigation bars or breadcrumbs in the layout template. In order to support and include breadcrumbs, the default template of the theme has copied to /docs/_layouts/default.html. The breadcrumb template is located /docs/_includes/breadcrumbs.html.
