# Consent Flows

The following diagrams illustrate the two supported flows for obtaining consents and retrieving data items:

1. Diagram 1 illustrates the consent flow using OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow. The expected interaction between our demo  _KST Basic FMIS_ system and our _KST Platform_  is depicted. _KST Basic FMIS_ a single page application (SPA) that supports the farmer in managing the fields of his/her farm. The data used by  _KST Basic FMIS_  is stored in our  _KST platform_.
2. Diagram 2 illustrates the consent flow using OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow. The expected interaction between our demo  _Agricultural Service Provider_ system and our _KST Platform_  is depicted.
