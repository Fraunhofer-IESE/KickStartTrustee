# Deployment

We provide containers to run our system. This allows us to provide a consistent environment for our software components regardless of whether they are running on a developers machine locally or on a virtual machine in a data center or in a kubernetes cluster at a public cloud provider.

## Container Registry

We use the gitlab built-in container registry ([TODO]()) to store our container images.
